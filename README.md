## reptinames
An R package to facilitate reptile nomenclatural standardization by interfacing with The Reptile Database.

Please contact me with any issues, I don't expect to update this often but will try to fix any errors.

Installation:
```
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("rstanton13/reptinames")
library(reptinames)
```

The package is relatively straightforward and functions are explained in their help pages. I will add more information here later.
